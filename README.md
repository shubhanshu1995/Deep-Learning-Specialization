# Deep Learning Specialization
Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

This repository contains all the solutions of the programming assignments along with datasets and images. 

**NOTE :** Use the solutions only for reference purpose :)

Deep Learning Specialization has five courses. 

**Courses:**
- **Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
- **Learning Objectives** :
   - Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
   - Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks
   - Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
   - Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
- **Programming Assignments**
